This is a transaction that sequentially creates two bundles. The first bundle creates a new Pumpfun token and purchases tokens from the Dev and Sniper wallets, and the second bundle sells tokens from the Sniper wallet and purchases tokens from multiple wallets simultaneously as soon as possible after the first bundle is created.
Our bot interacts directly with the pumpfun contract using cutting edge technologies such as jito-bundle, address lookup tables, version transactions, and pumpfun IDL. 
As you know, jito-bundle is a very good tool to protect against mev sandwich attacks.

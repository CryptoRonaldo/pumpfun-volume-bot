One of my notable projects is Pumpfun and Raydium volume bot.
Our bot interacts directly with the Pumpfun and Raydium using cutting edge technologies such as jito-bundle, address lookup tables, version transactions,  pumpfun IDL and Raydium. 
As you know, jito-bundle is a very good tool to protect against mev sandwich attacks.

The attached photo is just a test transaction history, I can show you the actual transaction histories if you want.

You can contact me through telegram, discord, email and whatsapp and can find contact info in my profile.
